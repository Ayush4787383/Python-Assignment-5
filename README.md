# Python Assignment 5 TASK 1
This Python program uses a dictionary to store students’ names and their marks. It takes a student’s name as input and checks whether the name exists in the dictionary. If found, it prints the student’s marks; otherwise, it displays a message saying the student is not found.


# Python-Assignment-5  TASK 2 
This Python program works with list slicing. It first creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, then extracts the first five elements using slicing. After that, it reverses the extracted elements using reverse slicing. Finally, it prints the original list, the extracted list, and the reversed list.
